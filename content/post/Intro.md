This should be officially the first post I write for my blog. I simply want to have an overview of this blog including introduction of myself, the reason I start blogging and the future content in this blog.

### Who am I

I hate self-introduction since I was a child, simply because I am not good at it. :) So skip this part. You can know me better in other posts instead of this poorly written paragraph. 

My name is Shao Yiyang, currently studying computer science at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I am interested in many technology-related topics, therefore some will be mentioned in my articles. Now I am doing an internship at Autodesk. Moreover, I am a member of NTU Supercomputing Team, which lets me know some interesting people and gives me a lot of fun. I may talk more about it in later posts.

A programmer. A dreamer. A maker. This is what I want to be.

### Why blogging

It has been some time since my first time having the blogging idea, inspired by my friend. There are tons of ideas crashing into my head everyday and I often have great experience in my life. I am thinking that I need to record them in some form. Nowadays, the social media platforms have already gave us excellent chance to show everything you want to share. However, that is not the form I prefer. Or, it is just not enough for me. I may need something more formal, more clear and having a sense of ritual, which I will go back and read through once more after several years. In addition, I regard continuously updating the blog as a motivation for me to explore new things. It pushes me to learn new stuff, to try out different things and to share in my blog. The another important reason is that I want to group all my fragmentary thoughts together into some complete articles. In this way, it helps me to think more clearly and express my own opinions in an acceptable way. So, I start to have the idea of blogging.

Now, I start the life of a new year, just had my 21st birthday and begin the internship at Autodesk. Everything seems fresh, so I want to have something new for the whole new life. After some preparation of researching and setting up, here I am.

### What will be included

Basically, Everything. I try to put all the things come up in my mind online. Considering my major and hobbies, the posts may mainly contain some computer technologies and tech-related products. But more often than not, I probably share about my life and my thoughts on what is happening  around the world, etc. There are many possibilities and I don't have any specific plan of what must be included and what cannot. So, expect everything.

More importantly, I'm aiming to have my blogs more elaborate. I need to ensure that my articles remain high quality after careful thinking and writing. At least, I will try my best.

### Finally. Let the journey begin!
