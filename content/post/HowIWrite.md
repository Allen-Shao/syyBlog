As a university student, I always have reports to write. As a programmer, I need to do documentation for my project. We all need to write things for some purpose.

For a very long time, people get used to Microsoft Word (or Pages for MacOS users). Most of people associate typing on a computer with Microsoft Word. Without doubt, Word is one of the most usable and functional tools to write documents. However, in my very personal opinion, I find it not suitable for me and many other normal users, I believe. Absolutely, Microsoft Word is still essential to be installed on the computer and many professions still need it daily. But in this post, I want to introduce several alternatives for writing on a computer and how I write staff.

## Google Doc

I believe, many people have already used google docs more than Microsoft Word. The functionality of Google doc is just like a basic version of Microsoft Word. These functions serve most of people well and make the documents look very simple and clear. But the most important feature of Google doc is collaboration. A huge amount of users are using Google drive and they all have Google accounts to synchronize many other services. It is so easy to share documents with others and invite others to write something together in real-time. Another advantage is that the documents are stored on cloud. It means that I can access my files anywhere as long as I have the Internet. I know Microsoft Word also has these similar features, but honestly Microsoft is just not quite there. Word now seems too heavy-weight and the cloud services are not satisfying.

So, I use Google doc for writing some Word-like documents or sometimes I even use it take casual notes (I actually write draft of my blog posts on Google doc first). Easy sharing and collaborating with others are  really handy.

### Something new, worth a try

Next, I will talk about two tools that make you focus more on the **content** you write instead of **style and formats**. Both of them take some time to learn and practice, but they are quite powerful when you master them.

## Latex

Simply put, Latex is a tool to generate PDF files. It is very suitable for relatively formal reports, acadamic paper or even CV for your career. It provides different packages that make codes, formulas, tables and pictures look nice and clean. When it comes to chapters, sections and paragraphs, Latex will help you solve all the complicated formatting problem and organize your words in their right positions.

There are plenty of latex compilers(tools) to choose. Some are stored locally, which are very space-consuming(Around 10GB). Instead, I recommand to use **Sharelatex**. It is a online platform, so it comipiled by the cloud servers. The advantages are obvious:

* Cloud Storage: All documents will be stored safely online, with sync support with Dropbox and Github

* Easy to use: Sharelatex provides tons of official tutorials and examples and makes first-time user gets used to latex quickly

* Collaboration: Doc owners can easily invite others to collaborate as easy as Google Doc

* Work Anytime, Anywhere: As long as you have access to the Internet, you can work with all your documents from any devices.

* Doc History: Sharelatex stores the history of the documents, you can restore them anytime.

## Markdown

Markdown is a simple html generator. It is made for web pages such as github wiki doc and some websites. My blog posts are purely based on Markdown. It is much easier than latex and takes no more than 10 minutes to learn. This is a simple, interactive tutorial for Markdown. Learn and ENJOY!  

## Conclusion

So, these are three main tools I use to write. It may need some time to practice, but they are totally worth trying.
