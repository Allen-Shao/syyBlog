***SPOILER!!!***  
<!--more-->

I have been a X-Men fan since I was very young. I still remembered when I was lying on the sofa and watch the original X-men movies at the age of around 10. 
Wolverine is definitely my favorite character. I didn't miss any one of the independent movie of Wolverine. Admittedly, the first one _Wolverine Origins_ is no good with bad production. 
Second one is also rated very low because of the boring plot about stories in Japan. However, this third and last one is absolutely great.  

Wolverine, a great superhero once, becomes old and is gradually loosing his ability. He never calls himself or lets other call him Wolverine anymore. 
Professor X, took care for all mutant students once, becomes unstable and cannot even control his own power. Nothing makes people more moved than heroes are no longer heroes, 
not because they don't want to be heroes, but because they are not able to anymore.  

I will simply talk about several points that impress me a lot.  
* Logan: Don't shoot the car. (A superhero is beaten down by some random car thieves)  
* Professor X died. What he said before his death: I don't deserve it, do I?  
* When Logan died, Laura called him "Father."  
* Lastly, of course, Logan took the medicine and fight.  

These are only my simple thoughts on this movie. Love it.
