We tend to have more devices these days. However, how can we work seamlessly between multiple devices? This post will introduce some personal practices that help enhance "continuity".

### Chrome
These days, web browser plays an important role when we use our computers or phones. **Chrome** easily becomes my first choice because of its Synchronization function. 
With one Google account, you are able to take all the settings, bookmarks and history with you. Opening tabs on other devices can quickly be viewed in current device. 
With Chrome, once login, everything is ready for you including passwords, autofill info and even extensions.  

### Cloud Storage
When using different devices, you may get used to different interfaces, but you still need all your data. So we need a cloud storage solution.  
Things like **Dropbox** and **Google Drive** are both nice choices, however, they may suffer from storage size limitation. If huge amounts of data need to be stored. A personal NAS is also recommended.  

### Cross-platform application with sync
When choosing everyday applications, you should better pay more attentions to those having versions for different platforms including Mac, Windows, iOS or Android. Moreover, I prefer applications with auto sync function built in. 
**Evernote** and **Microsoft Office** are very good examples.  

### Web App
Making use of web app is very convenient. It ensures that you can get similar interface and user experience on any device. In addition, all of your data is managed on cloud automatically so that you do not need to worry about forgetting data location. 
Things like Google Doc, Outlook Web App belong to this type.  

### Multi-platform IM
Instant Message is essential during our daily work. In order to communicate with others easily, use an IM like slack which can be logged in on different platform at same time. Also, all the message records are synchronized quickly.  

## More computer-related...

### Github
Github can be used as a cloud storage for codes. Using Github to sync code of various projects on different devices saves a lot of time.  

### SSH
To have a remote connected VPS is also a great idea. I can use SSH to access my Linux machine anywhere and start working with any hardware device available.  
  
  
Overall, cloud computing is the basic idea behind all of these methods. When needing to work on multiple devices, use above tips to enhance efficiency significantly.  
**Work Hard Anywhere:)**
