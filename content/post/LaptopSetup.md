With the development of personal computer, laptops with thin chassis and light weights also become powerful enough for normal users to complete 
their daily tasks, such as documenting, web browsing and video playing, etc. 
<!--more-->

Programmers like me also gradually migrate to the fashion of 
"cloud computing"". So computers are basically only for typing codes and remote servers can take over all other heavy work, 
at most of the time. However, when the laptops provide with great mobility and enough performance, 
it also inevitably sacrifices some important user experience like monitors and peripherals. 
In this post, I will share some of my opinions about using laptop to have a working setup.  

## Complete System  
The basic idea is to separate the laptop and other equipment(monitors, keyboard and mouse, etc.) 
and to have a simple connection between them. So we are able to plug in several cables(as few as possible) 
to laptop and then use the laptop just like a desktop. 
When we want to leave, just detach several cables and we are ready to go.  

Therefore, the great responsibility falls on this **"connection"** thing.  

## Power + Display Output + USB
If you only have a relatively old laptop with no fancy port such as thunderbolt or usb 3.1, this suitable.  
A USB port and any display output port(HDMI, DP or VGA, etc.) will be enough for a convenient laptop setup. 
However, USB 3.0 and display port with audio passthrough(HDMI, DP) will bring extra advantages.:) 
Almost every laptop nowadays should have these two ports. 
Then next step is to choose a monitor that has compatible port with your laptop and get a usb hub for all your external peripherals. The usb hub is better to 
have independent power input so that more devices can be connected stably.  
Here I will recommend Monitors with built in usb hub. This will be perfect for this type of setup. My personal choice currently is **Dell U2414H**. 
Now it is updated with new versions, which definitely worth checking out.  

## Power + Thunderbolt 2
Crazy number of people around me are using Macbook air and Macbook pro(NOT 2016 model, of course). They are lucky that they have the thunderbolt 2 connector, 
but unfortunately most of them never make use of it.  
Simply get a thunderbolt dock available in many places. It converts the thunderbolt port immediately into everything including display ports, usb ports, ethernet ports, SD card readers. Really EVERYTHING!  

## Thunderbolt 3
Many new laptops start to include thunderbolt 3 ports. This port is absolutely amazing and will be the future for at least 10+ years. It comes in a usb type c form factor, which is easy to use.
In addition, it is capable of replacing every port in a traditional computer, even POWER. This port makes laptop setup perfect. With one single cable, your laptop can transfer into a full desktop experience. And by plugging out only one cable, your laptop can be put into your bag and go.  
I really love this idea and hope more accessories will come in following years.  

## Some Futuristic Thoughts
Actually, for me, even one single cable is not good. My ideal laptop setup should be completely wireless. The whole desk is a connection dock and wireless charging pad. 
Throw the laptop on the desk and everything lights up and I am ready to work.  
This may not be real in many years, but I will be very glad if this comes true.
